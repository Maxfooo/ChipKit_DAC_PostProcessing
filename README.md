# ChipKit_DAC_PostProcessing

Run Analysis.py as main.

* The UI will run the microcontroller to perform a binary up counter sweep (12 bits) on a DAC, and read back the results.
* The post processing portion of the UI is not ready yet.
* Load 'Python_DAC_DAQ.pde' and 'Globals.h' onto a chipkit or arduino to run the python code.
* The project requires:
* Python 3.4+
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
